# Visually
A drag and drop website builder built in Svelte that generates clean code and is easier to use, giving everyone the freedom to host their project anywhere. The project is still in its very early developmental stage.

### To run this project:
1. Download the code
2. Install all the necessary packages using `npm install`
3. Now do `npm run dev` to view the project

Once the project reaches its first Beta version, you'll see a complete documentation here, from to how to use it to how this works under the hood so that people can contribute...
